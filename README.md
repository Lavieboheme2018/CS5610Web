Digital Pet Health Record Platform

Milestone 1 - Group3 - Wanyi Jiang, Sara Bavan, Kehan Yan

1. Project Description
Overview
The proposed application is a Digital Pet Health Record Platform designed to help pet owners manage and track their pets’ health records in a centralized and accessible manner. This platform addresses the common problem pet owners face when managing scattered health information across multiple sources, particularly when caring for multiple pets or working with different veterinarians.

Pet owners often struggle to keep track of essential health information for their pets, such as vaccination schedules, vet visits, and medication timelines. This issue becomes more challenging for those with multiple pets or those managing records from different veterinarians. Disorganized records can lead to missed appointments, inconsistent health care, and difficulty accessing vital medical history when needed.

This Digital Pet Health Record Platform offers a streamlined solution for pet health management. By organizing pet health data into accessible profiles and providing timely reminders, our platform helps pet owners take better care of their pets. With features like individual pet profiles, detailed health records, reminders, and data visualization, pet owners can monitor their pets' well-being easily.

Key Features
Pet Profile Creation: Create individual profiles for each pet with essential information like breed, age, weight, and health conditions.
Health Record Management: Store and manage health data, such as vaccinations, medications, and vet visits, organized in an easy-to-read timeline.
Appointment and Medication Reminders: Set reminders for upcoming appointments and medication schedules to ensure timely care.
Data Visualization: Visualize health trends (e.g., weight changes) through charts for better monitoring.
Multi-Pet Management: Manage records for multiple pets within a single account.
Vet Information Integration: Store and manage veterinarian information, including contact details and visit history.
Sharing Feature: Securely share pet health data with caretakers and veterinarians.
